-- Assignment 6: Working with Multiple Tables
-- Question 4: Write a query that determines what percentage of the customers in the database have purchased a ticket to one or more of the events.

SELECT ROUND( COUNT(DISTINCT(t.customer_id)) 
            / COUNT(DISTINCT(c.id))::decimal * 100,
            2)
AS percent
FROM tickets AS t
RIGHT JOIN customers AS c ON t.customer_id = c.id;

-- Assignment 6: Working with Multiple Tables
-- Question 5: Write a query that returns the name of each event and how many tickets were sold for it, in order from most popular to least popular.

SELECT e.name, COUNT(t.event_id) AS popularity
FROM tickets AS t
RIGHT JOIN events AS e
ON t.event_id = e.id
GROUP BY e.name
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

-- Assignment 6: Working with Multiple Tables
-- Question 6: Write a query that returns the user id, email address, and number of events for all customers that have purchased tickets to three events.

SELECT c.id, c.email, COUNT(DISTINCT(t.event_id))
FROM customers AS c
JOIN tickets AS t
ON c.id = t.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(t.event_id)) = 3;

-- Assignment 6: Working with Multiple Tables
-- Question 7: Write a query to print out a report of all tickets purchased by the customer with the email address 'gennaro.rath@mcdermott.co'. The report should include the event name and starts_at and the seat's section name, row, and seat number.

SELECT e.name AS event, 
       e.starts_at,
       s2.name AS section,
       s1.row,
       s1.number AS seat
FROM tickets AS t
     JOIN events    AS e  ON t.event_id = e.id
     JOIN seats     AS s1 ON t.seat_id = s1.id
     JOIN sections  AS s2 ON s1.section_id = s2.id
     JOIN customers AS c  ON t.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.email = 'gennaro.rath@mcdermott.co';

-- Assignment 12: Many-to-Many Relationships
-- Question 1: The books_categories table from this database was created with foreign keys that don't have the NOT NULL and ON DELETE CASCADE constraints. Go ahead and add them now.

ALTER TABLE books_categories
ALTER COLUMN book_id SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN category_id SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE books_categories
DROP CONSTRAINT books_categories_book_id_fkey,
ADD CONSTRAINT books_categories_book_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE books_categories
DROP CONSTRAINT books_categories_category_id_fkey,
ADD CONSTRAINT books_categories_category_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Assignment 12: Many-to-Many Relationships
-- Question 2: Write a SQL statement that will return the following result:

SELECT b.id, b.author, STRING_AGG(c.name, ', ') AS categories
  FROM books AS b
       JOIN books_categories AS bc ON b.id = bc.book_id
       JOIN categories AS c ON c.id = bc.category_id
 GROUP BY b.id
 ORDER BY id;

-- Assignment 12: Many-to-Many Relationships
-- Question 3: Write SQL statements to insert the following new books into the database. 
-- What do you need to do to ensure this data fits in the database?

ALTER TABLE books
ALTER COLUMN title TYPE varchar(80);

INSERT INTO books
(author, title) VALUES 
('Lynn Sherr', 'Sally Ride: America''s First Woman in Space'),
('Charlotte BrontÃ«', 'Jane Eyre'),
('Meeru Dhalwala and Vikram Vij', 'Vij''s: Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine');

INSERT INTO categories
(name) VALUES
('Space Exploration'),
('Cookbook'),
('South Asia');

INSERT INTO books_categories VALUES
(4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 7),
(5, 2), (5, 4),
(6, 8), (6, 1), (6, 9);

-- Assignment 12: Many-to-Many Relationships
-- Question 4: Write a SQL statement to add a uniqueness constraint on the combination of columns book_id and category_id of the books_categories table. 
-- This constraint should be a table constraint; so, it should check for uniqueness on the combination of book_id and category_id across all rows of the books_categories table.

ALTER TABLE books_categories
ADD UNIQUE (book_id, category_id);

-- Assignment 12: Many-to-Many Relationships
-- Question 5: Write a SQL statement that will return the following result:

SELECT c.name, COUNT(b.id) AS book_count, STRING_AGG(b.title, ', ') AS book_titles
  FROM books AS b
       JOIN books_categories AS bc ON b.id = bc.book_id
       JOIN categories AS c ON c.id = bc.category_id
 GROUP BY c.name
 ORDER BY c.name;

-- Assignment 13: Many-to-Many Relationships
-- Question 2: Write the SQL statement needed to create a join table that will allow a film to have multiple directors, and directors to have multiple films. Include an id column in this table, and add foreign key constraints to the other columns.

CREATE TABLE directors_films (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  director_id integer REFERENCES directors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  film_id integer REFERENCES films(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Assignment 13: Many-to-Many Relationships
-- Question 3: Write the SQL statements needed to insert data into the new join table to represent the existing one-to-many relationships.

INSERT INTO directors_films
(film_id, director_id) VALUES
(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5),
(6, 6), (7, 3), (8, 7), (9, 8), (10, 4);
